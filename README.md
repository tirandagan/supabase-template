# Cursor App Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It serves as a template for applications created using Cursor with Supabase as the database, providing a structured starting point for building applications with a modern tech stack.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Postgres, Supabase, Drizzle ORM, Server Actions
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Getting Started
